    "# Using Libraries for ML and AI\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why we implemented logistic regression and a simple neural network from scratch was to understand the internals of these methods. In practice, there are excellent libraries and frameworks that you can rely on for ML and AI instead of coding them from scratch. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will introduce you to two such libraries - scikit learn and pytorch. In this assignment, you will use scikit learn (which is sort of the default choice in python for a machine learning library) for logistic regression and pytorch for neural networks. There are several popular deep learning frameworks like pytorch, keras, tensorflow, and so on and you are free to learn any deep learning framework you like since the underlying concepts are fairly similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main task for you in this assignment is to familiarize yourself and learn how to use these standard libraries. Please go through the documentation, tutorials, and online resources that are freely available to learn more about them."
